= Logging

When running the applicatoin you'll get output like this:

```
â‡’  gradle run

> Task :run
starting logging example
deploying verticles
deploying tcp server verticle
deploying tcp client verticle
Starting tcp server verticle
Starting tcp client verticle
Created the server
Client connection created
buffer: Hello there, server!
```

but if you notice the `TcpServerVerticle` class you'll see that `setLogActivity(true)` is set to true. So no extra logging is occurring.
